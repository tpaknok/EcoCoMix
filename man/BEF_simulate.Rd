\details{
The simulated relationship is \deqn{Y = X_{0}+b_{1}X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}}

\eqn{X_{0}} is the population-level intercept. \eqn{X_{2}} is a variable with compoisitional autocorrelation, with the extent of phylogenetic signal depending on lambda_true. \eqn{X_{1}} can be species richness, a variable with or without compositional autocorrelation, depending on signals_X. \eqn{b_{1}} is the poluation-level effect of \eqn{X_{1}} and can be modified by users. \eqn{X_{3}} is the random noise, defaulted as \eqn{N(0,1)}.

\eqn{X_{2}} (and \eqn{X_{1}} if signals_X = "phy_cor") follows \deqn{MVN(0,{C_{comm})}}

\eqn{C_{comm}} represents the correlation matrix between communities. The estent of phylogenetic influence depends on lambda_true.
